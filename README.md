# mechanical-keyboard package

Coworkers complaining that your [cherry blues](http://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_Blue) are too loud? Or maybe you're just curious what all the hype is about?

Type like a **pro** with this atom package - it will make mechanical keyboard noises when you type.

# Usage

By default, the toggle switch is bound to `ctrl+alt-m k`. Toggle it on - whoa! Toggle it off - well, you're back to where you began.

**Note** That's a two step key activation - `ctrl+alt+m` and then `k`.

Alternatively, you can use the menu item that's found in the Packages Menu: `Packages->Mechanical Keyboard->Toggle`
